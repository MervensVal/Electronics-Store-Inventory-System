VARCHAR — Data is stored in the NLS_CHARACTERSET encoding. If there are other database instances on the same server, you may be restricted by them; and vice versa, since you have to share the setting. 
Such a field can store any data that can be encoded using that character set, and nothing else. So for example if the character set is MS-1252, you can only store characters like English letters, 
a handful of accented letters, and a few others (like € and —). Your application would be useful only to a few locales, unable to operate anywhere else in the world. For this reason, it is considered A Bad Idea.
(Positive is that it might take up less space)

*NVARCHAR — Data is stored in a Unicode encoding. Every language is supported. A Good Idea. ll modern operating systems and development platforms use Unicode internally. By using nvarchar rather than varchar, 
you can avoid doing encoding conversions every time you read from or write to the database.
