VARCHAR — Data is stored in the NLS_CHARACTERSET encoding. If there are other database instances on the same server, you may be restricted by them; and vice versa, since you have to share the setting. 
Such a field can store any data that can be encoded using that character set, and nothing else. So for example if the character set is MS-1252, you can only store characters like English letters, 
a handful of accented letters, and a few others (like € and —). Your application would be useful only to a few locales, unable to operate anywhere else in the world. For this reason, it is considered A Bad Idea.
(Positive is that it might take up less space)

*NVARCHAR — Data is stored in a Unicode encoding. Every language is supported. A Good Idea. ll modern operating systems and development platforms use Unicode internally. By using nvarchar rather than varchar, 
you can avoid doing encoding conversions every time you read from or write to the database.

decimal [(p [,s])]

Where,

p stands for Precision, the total number of digits in the value, i.e. on both sides of the decimal point
s stands for Scale, number of digits after the decimal point
The default value of p is 18 and s is 0 and for both these values, the minimum is 1 and the maximum is 38.

In short, by defining parameters in the SQL Decimal data type, we are estimating how many digits a column or a variable will have and also the number of digits to the right of the decimal point.

For instance, decimal (4,2) indicates that the number will have 2 digits before the decimal point and 2 digits after the decimal point, something like this has to be the number value- ##.##.
